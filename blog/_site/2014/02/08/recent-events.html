					<p>This past year has been rough. I can start with that. Not so much on the physical side, but on the mental side. Sometimes I just sit and think about how much this past year has changed the way I live, the way I think, the way I eat, the way I talk, the way I breathe. The list continues on. I guess I can start with my past experiences.</p>

<p>In Junior High, or as people call it these days, Middle School, I was as stable as you could get. I was your average young teenager (and I still am a young teenager), always curious about how life worked and how I was supposed to fit myself into that. I was beginning to think about how I fit inside the massive and overwhelming mental image we call the world. I was massively shy, and I was &#8220;the new kid&#8221;. Noone knew me, because I, my whole life, was a transfer student to a school in a town a little north of where I currently live. That was mainly the case because I needed a after-school program that worked with my parents&#8217; schedule at the time. I couldn&#8217;t ride a bus because the town was too far away from my home. So, the switch to a new school where I knew noone was a very difficult task for me, since it took me about 5 years in Elementary School to even start to get friends. And then I lost all of that progress. New school, new people, new culture, new vocabulary, new mindset, new /everything/. It was like taking a brick and shoving it into my face without any heed or warning.</p>
