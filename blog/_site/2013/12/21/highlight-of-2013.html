				<h2 class="content">My Highlight of 2013</h2>
				<section>
					<p>I would have to say my highlight of 2013 is the simple thought of people I care about, caring about me.</p>

<p>Knowing out there, whether it be locally or international, people care when you have a depressing day, or that you had a fantastic day, or the fact that they can converse and laugh with you is truly the best feeling there is.</p>

<p>I went through a rather depressing childhood, not knowing anyone, always being the weirdo, always being bullied, and just being treated like you don&#8217;t exist. It got better in the latter part of elementary school, but then I was a transfer student, and I moved to a more local school when junior high began.</p>

<p>Junior high was my worst experience there was. I befriended a person that was very selfish and uncaring. In 7th grade he turned on me, calling me gay and a homosexual, eventually leading up to the whole school doing it in the middle of the grade. Every day I had thoughts of suicide that just filled my mind, and it came close that I nearly attempted it one night.</p>

<p>Thankfully that person moved away, and now I&#8217;m in high school. I started from scratch, per se, trying all I could to reshape me. Thankfully, I now have a few friends that I can speak with on a daily basis. Even then, over the past year I have been apart of a family in a way on a Minecraft server. It has moved passed that and they really are my &#8216;other&#8217; family. I get to speak with them almost every day and the simple fact that they enjoy my company and appreciate myself as a person is truly, truly the best gift there is.</p>

<p>Being Christmas time now and how everyone is talking about gifts and the holidays, they really don&#8217;t know that they best gift of all is friendship. Without it, depression isn&#8217;t a feeling or emotion, it&#8217;s what you are. 2013 has been the best year of my life, and I hope it can continue on in the upcoming years.</p>

<p>Merry Christmas everyone.</p>
