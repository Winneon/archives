title: Life Is A Beautiful Thing
---

Life is a beautiful thing. It is amongst us every day. From nothing, a soul sprouts and becomes attached in the hearts of many. Some people these days take this life everyone shares for granted. Either they don't care, or they feel like nothing bad can happen to them or the people they are affecting.

Today, this morning, an LHS student, Gaby Montoya, died. I never even knew her, or what she looked like, or her friends, or anything. But, even when that is true, I can't help but feel pain, along with everyone that was close with her. The sight of seeing people mourn for someone that I most likely walked by every day is overwhelming.

Many people today, whether it be the students of LHS, the close friends of Gaby, or Gaby's parents, are mourning for the loss of Gaby, and that is a very depressing thing to hear. But, despite all of the loss, there is always hope. I, and with many people, believe that Gaby is now living in the place of He. And for those of you who fear that there is nothing left, but an empty hole inside, know that she is smiling, for all the love you have given to her, is more than she could have ever asked for.

Revelation 21:4 states, "He will wipe away every tear from their eyes, and death shall be no more, neither shall there be mourning, nor crying, nor pain anymore, for the former things have passed away."

Rest in peace, Gaby. Every soul of LHS brings their heart out to you, with faith and joy, until the end of time, with much love.
