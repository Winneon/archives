title: My Peace
---

Sometimes I imagine myself playing a piano in a dark room, with noone watching, playing the most utterly beautiful, yet sad song there could ever be. I am alone in the room with the piano, my most favourite instrument. Nothing in the world exists except that room with me and the piano. This piano is very dear to me. I will protect it with my life, and the piano will do the same. I have known this piano for years on end. In that room with me and the piano, I am playing the most beautiful song, in perfect harmony with the piano. Nothing in existence can stop me from playing the piano. Nothing in existence can break the bond the piano and I share. I love the piano with every ounce of my soul, and the piano, the same for I. That, is my fantasy. That, is my peace. And nothing in this universe can prevent me from reaching that beautiful and majestic peace, sitting in that room, playing the most sad and beautiful song, never ending, on the piano that I love with every ounce of my soul, until the end of time.
