title: A Dip Into The Past
---

Sometimes, life doesn't seem like it's worth it.

And you will do whatever it takes, no matter the cost, to remedy that.

I am age 15. My name is Jesse Bryan. I seem like your average 15 year old, and I try to act that way. I have a rather excruciating past. I do not think of it, because it is not what I am now, and it shall never be. My past is nothing like how I am today. My life, today, it built upon the pride of being kind to people. It is what makes me happy, being kind and generous to people, even when they do not deserve it. It is my greatest joy. Some people may not be able to understand that, but that is ok. They have their own worries to deal with. And I, also have mine.

When I was in Junior High, or Middle School, I wasn't very sensitive. I was pretty open to the world. I was what you would call now, and "open book". I didn't enjoy music, I was usually sleeping, or using my computer when I had the time. I had 0 friends, I didn't know anyone because I had just moved from a another school, in which I was a transfer student to. But yes, begin 6th grade. This is the part of your life where you start your mental journey of "discovering who you are", at least, that's what it was for me. Everyone I saw, including me, had their hormones raging, learning what their pathetic meaning of what the word "love" means, and so on and so forth. But, I was a lonely stranger, to put it blunt. No friends, didn't know anyone, noone knew me, you get the idea. I was also very shy and socially awkward. I didn't talk, because I simply felt no need to. I had noone to talk to, and noone talked to me. And that's how life went.

In the beginning of Junior High, and still today, I lived in a rather rural area. The great thing was, was that the school I went to was literally right next to my neighbourhood. On one of the weekends, I was outside picking up leaves from a previous outdoor bush trimming, and someone that lived on my street came to me while on his bike, completely randomly, and asked to help me. I was completely willing to use some help. It was hot outside due to it being September, and when you live in Texas in the fall, it gets *pretty* hot. This particular person's name? Matthew Peters.

Over the next few weeks, we discussed random topics at school, since he happened to go to the same school I went to, and he was in the same grade. We got along extremely well, and sooner or later, I had gained my first "real" friend. He also was very socially awkward, and he was a great person to talk to when bored. We were both interesting in technology, more specifically, networking, computing, programming, etc. That field of technology. We often were in the same class periods, and our friendship grew stronger every day. It was amazing, since I didn't really know the meaning of friends before that, and it was like taking a drink from something that you haven't drunk in years. It was very refreshing. His personality though, was what got me.

I told you earlier about my own personality. I pride myself on pleasuring others, being kind for others, trying to be generous, even when the recieving end doesn't deserve the generosity. Him on the other hand, was... different. He liked things his own way, but to the extreme. He didn't work well with others (which I have to admit, I don't either...), and he absolutely loved to cuss. That's another topic. I don't usually like to cuss. I feel like there are many other vocabulary choices to use rather than your random "fuck" or "shit" in every other sentence you say. So, to put it mildly, our personalities clashed often.

Now, to fast forward a year. 7th grade. I'm going to say it now. I did not enjoy this year for me at all. This was the year of my climax, my defining of who I am. This year defined who I am, how I think, what I eat, how I interpret things, how I judge people, how I became the person I am today. To start, Matthew's continuous clashing of the personalities were starting to take its toll. I never understood why, but he started to prefer to do things by himself, alone, away from people. He had a constant attitude, he wasn't very understanding, and he didn't give anything for anyone's opinion. I understand now, as I'm typing this, that he must have had his own issues he was facing. But, that doesn't matter anymore. I do not care for him. He is a smudge on my shoe, for all I care. His opinions are nothing to me.

Matthew, started a trend. To put it bluntly, it was the misinformation of me being gay, or homosexual. This may not seem that much of a big of a deal, but it is. It spread like a virus. Within one week it seemed, the whole grade loved to gossip about me and my supposed homosexuality. The abuse was intense. Not the physical abuse. The mental abuse. You cannot understand it. It's like someone opening your mind, taking out all of your hopes, dreams, joys, and love and replacing it with nothing but an endless supply of fear, hopelessness, pain, and more fear. Every period, of every hour, of every single wretched day of that year, I would get tormented with the mental abuse with the simple idea in place: That I was worth nothing, that noone cared for me, that noone will ever love me for who I am, for who I want to be. I was nothing, in their minds, but a homosexual that was stupid, weak, and worth not a single penny. I was nothing. NOTHING.

Every single day of that year, I came home, I cried, I screamed, I yelled, I tore apart my pillow from the inside out, I broke dishes and cups, and then before anyone came home, I hid this away, I stored it in myself, all that anger, hatred, depression, emptiness, and became the loving, kind person I am right now. I excused all of the comments at school, I didn't listen to them, all of their pathetic voices inside myself. I just came home, cried my soul out until there was *nothing* left, and I went back to myself to my family again. Imagine all of this, put on repeat, never ending, never to feel or hope or dream, till time ceases. One night, I couldn't take it any longer.

That night, I felt like nothing was left. I just didn't feel. I didn't experience emotion. No love, no joy, no fear, no anger, no nothing. I had emptied my supply of tears. The only voice in myself, was repeating the same thing. Over and over. Like a tape glitched out, stuck on repeat. Only 2 words. Never ending. "END IT". So, I tried to end it. I found one of those electric cords in my garage, I put it into a loop, and tied it together, nice and tight. And I hung it in my living room. I got a stool. And I stood on it. And what seemed for the longest time, I just heard those 2 words in my head, over and over. For eterinity it seemed. And I decided to just quit those voices, jump off that stool, and hang myself. But I didn't. I am not joking when I say this, because it was VERY real to me. As clear as I see my friends today. I saw a young woman. Standing in front of me. In pure white clothes. With the most beautiful smile a person can ever see. And she said one riddle. In the most beautiful voice I had ever heard.

"Close your eyes."

"Count to three."

"One."

"Two."

"Three."

"Now, open them."

"The word is a good place, everything you have ever felt, is nothing now."

"Everything is going to be okay. Trust me."

Every day after that, I forgot about the horrible things they did to me. I dealt with physical abuse. But, nothing of that mattered. Because, I believed that, everything, no matter how horrible it can get, will ALWAYS get better. And that is a fact. That is why I believe in my God today. Because, after what I have learned, after all of the pounding, the screaming, the yelling, the cutting, the self harm, the suicidal thoughts and actions, the thought that you were worth NOTHING, that it is not true. That THEY, the people critizing you, are worth nothing. They are nothing in a never ending and beautiful heaven. There will always be people that love you. Even if it doesn't feel that way, He will always love you. Never ending, for all eternity. He will always be there to help you when you feel like life is worth absolutely trash. He is love, and He cares for you. And no matter what people say to you, always. BELIEVE. That life will get better. And it will. That. Is the ultimate truth.
