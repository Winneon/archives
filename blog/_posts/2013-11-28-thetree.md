title: The Tree
---

There is a tree out front. A tree that is valiant throughout all the seasons. A tree that is majestic with its movements in the wind, the way it twists and turns like music with the hard touch of the wind. I am very proud to watch this tree. This tree may not be mine, but it is mine in my heart. Sometimes, when I am watching that tree, it feels like I'm moving with the wind aswell, majestically and valiant. I hope this tree never dies. I want to watch it forever and ever. It is like a part of me that just cannot leave. If it ever does, I will be missing that part and I will be only half of what I am. I would be broken in two. And for that reason, I will never allow this tree to die, for I love that tree.
